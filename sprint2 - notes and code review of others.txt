to finish css on gallery and editor: do

then do work with touch

put titles on btns

send requests to websites like this:  //:
it sais that the request will be sent in htpp or https,
according to the current site, if it secured - https,
otherwise - http

code review notes:
in html, put css classes on element from the more general to 
the more specific.
for example: continar(the general one)  nav-container(the specific one)

should seperate css files by categories (base, layout, helpers and main.. for example)
use @import to import css files (the order of the css imports
is as written - the first import will be at the top of
the file, the sceonf after it, etc..)

on images - set only the width or height - not both,
in order that the image will keep it aspect ratio
